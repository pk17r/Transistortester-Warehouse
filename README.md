# Transistortester Warehouse

The Transistortester is a device for identifying and checking electronic components.
It also offers additional functionality like a PWM signal generator for example.
And it's OSHW.

This repo is meant to provide a convenient way to download firmware packages,
documentation files, PCB files and more. Therefore it's structured differently
from the main repo.

The project's webpage is https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR_Transistortester
and the main repo is https://github.com/kubi48/TransistorTester-source.

BTW, all the inexpensive Transistortesters sold on your favourite shopping platform
are based on this project and can be updated with the original OSHW firmware versions.
